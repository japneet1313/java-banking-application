## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## D# Banking Application (Java)

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a simple **Banking Application** written in Java. It was created as part of my Java Programming Assignment in Semester 3. 

The program lets a user:
- Create a new bank account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- View account details
- Update contact details

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- `Account` class for storing and managing account information.
- `UserInterface` class with a menu-driven program.
- Supports multiple accounts using arrays.
- Input checking for deposits, withdrawals, and account numbers.
- Uses string handling for account holder details.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-application.git
   cd banking-application
   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac BankingApplication.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java BankingApplication
   ```

## Project Structure
```
BankingApplication.java    # Main class
Account.java               # Account class
UserInterface.java         # User interface class
```
